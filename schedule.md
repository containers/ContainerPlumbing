# Event Schedule

Our themes for this year, based on the proposals we received are Linux kernel
features, OCI innovation, improving image pulls and image building, and container
image and supply chain security.

[Please join us](/register)!

## Attending

All of the presentations will be "sessions" in the HopIn conference application, except for the "Welcome", which will take place on the Main Stage. Sessions become visible in the HopIn site ten minutes before they start.  

All sessions will include Q&A, time permitting.  You may ask your question at any point in the Session Chat alongside the presentation.  The moderator will track these and repeat them to the speaker at the appropriate time.  If we run out of time during the session, the speaker might follow up with you in the Hallway Track.  Please adhere to the [code of conduct](/conduct).

A few sessions are discussion sessions, and attendees will be encouraged to ask questions and participate aloud and by chat.  If you want to say something aloud, put "I want to make a statement aloud" or "I want to ask a question aloud" and the moderator will enable your video and mic at the appropriate time (we are strictly limited on how many people can have live mics at once).

If you get "video streaming error", try using a different web browser.  Our apologies for failing to provide captions for most sessions; the techonology we tested for this didn't work out.

## Hallway Track

All day March 9th and 10th, we will have a parallel "session" called the "Hallway Track."  This is an open session where any attendee may share audio and video, for impromptu discussions or follow-ups on sessions, as well as just meeting people.  The Hallway Track will not be recorded.

## Video Recording

All sessions will be video recorded, and offered on the [Red Hat Community](https://www.youtube.com/c/RedHatCommunity) video channel after editing.  Sessions may also be available via the speakers' own video channels.  If you choose to ask a question out loud, you will be on the recording.

There is no conference site for sharing slides, but many speakers may choose to share slides on their own.
