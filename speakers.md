# Submit a Proposal

ContainerPlumbing is looking for proposals around everything containers below the orchestration layer.  This includes (but is not limited to):

* Container runtimes, including WASM
* Image building
* Image scanning
* Container security and isolation
* Virtualization inside containers
* Containers on alternate architectures and platforms
* Linux cgroups and other kernel features
* Container OSes
* Containers on non-Linux OSes

Projects we want to hear about include (but are not limited to): Buildah, CRI-O, Linux cGroups & SecComp, podman, containerd, Tern, Kind, Clair, Skopeo, CoreOS, Flatcar Linux, Katacontainers, Kubevirt, OCI, and more.  Basically, if it lives below the scheduling & orchestration layer, then we're interested in hearing about it. Presented technologies should be open source.

While we think that Kubernetes, Openshift, Che and similar projects are awesome, this is not the place for them.  There's lots of other conferences covering those.

By submitting a proposal, you are agreeing to the [ContainerPlumbing Code of Conduct](/conduct).

## Deadlines

Please submit your proposal by February 10, 2021, at 23:59 UTC (7pm Eastern).

We will chose which proposals get selected by February 17th and inform all speakers.

## Talk Formats

We'll be hosting two kinds of sessions:

Presentation Sessions (25m): this will be your normal slides/demo talking session, with 15 minutes of presentation and demo, and 10 minutes of questions from the audience.  Live demos, or even recorded video demos, are highly encouraged.  Slides are not required if you have enough demo time or other visual interest.

Discussion Session (50m): these sessions will be for open discussion of topics of general technical interest, like improvements to Linux namespaces, new features for the CRI, etc.  They will be 50 minutes long.  As part of this session proposal, you will need to name at least three people who will be participating in the discussion.  Discussions will also be open to audience members.

## Submit Proposal
