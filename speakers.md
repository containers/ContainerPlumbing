# Submit a Proposal

ContainerPlumbing is [looking for proposals](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/container-plumbing-days/program/cfp/) around everything containers below the orchestration layer.  This includes (but is not limited to):

* Container runtimes, including WASM
* Image building
* Image scanning
* Image transports
* Container security and isolation
* Virtualization inside containers
* Containers on alternate architectures and platforms
* Linux cgroups and other kernel features
* Container OSes
* Containers on non-Linux OSes
* Containers and filesystem storage

Projects we want to hear about include (but are not limited to): Buildah, CRI-O, Linux cGroups & SecComp, eBPF, podman, containerd, Tern, Kind, Clair, Skopeo, CoreOS, Flatcar Linux, Katacontainers, Kubevirt, OCI, nerdctl, uBlue, and more.  Basically, if it lives below the scheduling & orchestration layer, then we're interested in hearing about it. Presented technologies should be open source.

While we think that Kubernetes, Openshift, Argo, Istio, Knative, and similar projects are awesome, this is not the place for them.  There's lots of other conferences covering those.

By submitting a proposal, you are agreeing to the [LF Code of Conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct/).

## Deadlines

Please submit your proposal by February 6, 2023, at 23:59 PST.

We will chose which proposals get selected by February 26th and inform all speakers.

The conference will take place April 15th, in Seattle, WA.

## Submit a Proposal

You can submit a proposal using the [CfP Page](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/container-plumbing-days/program/cfp).
