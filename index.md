Container Plumbing Days will be **March 9-10, 2021**

The CfP will be posted in January.

## Container Plumbing?

The Container Plumbing Days will be a 2-day event to investigate, discuss, hack, learn, and celebrate the "lower-level" open source container technologies, everything from the container runtime on down to the Linux kernel.

Container orchestration and top-level applications may get most of the exposure, but they only work because of an infrastructure of supporting tools and libraries: in short, the "plumbing" that makes platforms like Kubernetes work.  There's plenty of development still to do there, and plenty of new ideas that have not yet been fully explored.

Concepts we plan to explore include:

* Container runtimes
* Image building
* Image scanning
* Container security and isolation
* Virtualization inside containers
* Containers on alternate architectures and platforms
* Linux cgroups and other kernel features

The open source projects and technologies we hope to see at the event include Buildah, CRI-O, Katacontainers, Kubevirt, Clair, Skopeo, Cgroups2, Krustlet, Seccomp, Podman, KIND, Tern, and many others.  If your project involves lower-level container resources, consider proposing a session!

## Sponsors
