## Container Plumbing Days 2024

Container Plumbing Days is now an event of the Open Container Initiative.  As such, you can proceed to its [LF Events Page](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/container-plumbing-days/).

The [schedule is now live](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/container-plumbing-days/program/schedule/).

In 2024, we're going to have a one-day *in-person* event full of container runtime hacking, image building, alternate platforms, and more.  

**Date**: April 15, 2024

**Location**: [Seattle Convention Center, Seattle, WA](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/container-plumbing-days/attend/venue-travel/)

Container Plumbing Day immediately precedes the [Open Source Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/), and is held together with the Open Container Initiative meeting.  You are not required to register for the OS Summit in order to attend.

## Container Plumbing?

Container Plumbing Days is an event to investigate, discuss, hack, learn, and celebrate the "lower-level" open source container technologies, everything from the container runtime on down to the Linux kernel.

You can see the kind of sessions we've had in our [videos](/videos).

Container orchestration and top-level applications may get most of the exposure, but they only work because of an infrastructure of supporting tools and libraries: in short, the "plumbing" that makes platforms like Kubernetes work.  There's plenty of development still to do there, and plenty of new ideas that have not yet been fully explored.

Concepts we explore include:

* Container runtimes
* Image building
* Image scanning
* Container security and isolation
* Virtualization inside containers
* Containers on alternate architectures and platforms
* Linux cgroups and other kernel features
* Container engines on alternate platforms
* Image transports
* File system storage for containers
* Container-based/immutable OSes

The open source projects and technologies we hope to see at the event include Buildah, CRI-O, Katacontainers, Kubevirt, Clair, Skopeo, Cgroups2, Krustlet, Seccomp, Podman, KIND, Tern, WASM, uBlue, and many others.  If your project involves lower-level container resources, consider proposing a session!
