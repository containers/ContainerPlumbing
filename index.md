## Container Plumbing Days 2023

After a year of postponement, Container Plumbing Days is *back*!

In 2023, we're going to have a two-day virtual event full of container runtime hacking, image building, alternate platforms, and more.  It will take place March 22nd and 23rd, from around 1300 UTC to 1800 UTC.

Join us!  But first, [submit a proposal](/speakers)!

## Container Plumbing?

Container Plumbing Days is a 2-day online event to investigate, discuss, hack, learn, and celebrate the "lower-level" open source container technologies, everything from the container runtime on down to the Linux kernel.

You can see the kind of sessions we had in 2021 in the [Red Hat Community Video channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7XzoMZaGbY&list=PLVuc-VIfmlz1eSDhDVfAL0EbiQRvAX3gc).

Container orchestration and top-level applications may get most of the exposure, but they only work because of an infrastructure of supporting tools and libraries: in short, the "plumbing" that makes platforms like Kubernetes work.  There's plenty of development still to do there, and plenty of new ideas that have not yet been fully explored.

Concepts we will explore include:

* Container runtimes
* Image building
* Image scanning
* Container security and isolation
* Virtualization inside containers
* Containers on alternate architectures and platforms
* Linux cgroups and other kernel features
* Container engines on alternate platforms
* Image transports
* File system storage for containers

The open source projects and technologies we hope to see at the event include Buildah, CRI-O, Katacontainers, Kubevirt, Clair, Skopeo, Cgroups2, Krustlet, Seccomp, Podman, KIND, Tern, WASM, and many others.  If your project involves lower-level container resources, consider proposing a session!
