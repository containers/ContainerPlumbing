Thank you for volunteering to moderate Container Plumbing!

What follows are instructions on all the things you need to do as a moderator, plus things that you could do if you have extra time.

Your duties before the session you're moderating starts are:

1. AV Enablement for the speaker
2. Find out how to introduce them
3. Check on how they want to handle questions
4. See if they have a slide link
5. Share in the "event" chat (there is also a session chat) the upcoming session (share the title and speakers name). You can find the schedule [here](https://containerplumbing.org/schedule).

Once the session starts, you need to:

1. Introduce the speaker
2. For discussion sessions, introduce the rules of discussion
3. Check the chat for questions and share them with the speaker at the appropriate time (usually after their presentation)
4. Check the chat for [Code of Conduct](https://containerplumbing.org/conduct.html) violations and boot the violator
5. Check the chat for general conference questions and answer them ("is this video being recorded?")
6. Warn the speaker if they are running over time
7. For discussion sessions, enable AV for discussion participants
8. Near the end of the session, let people know about [the feedback survey](https://forms.gle/gamtSHwjXWD2VNxp9)

Other things you can do, if you have time:

1. Participate in the "Event chat" for the conference and notify folks of upcoming sessions.
2. Tweet out upcoming sessions

## Joining Sessions

Each talk has a separate session room (only the Lightning talks are in the same room all together). Your session room will appear in the Hopin 20 minutes before the scheduled time. Please join the session 10 minutes before the scheduled time to connect with speakers and get them ready (prepare their slides, test an audio, and video setup). You as a moderator need to be present in the session room to give speakers rights to share their audio/video and slides.
## AV Enablement

First, see these Hopin Tutorials:

* [sessions](https://support.hopin.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402442259220-Tips-for-Speaking-in-and-Moderating-Sessions) (scroll down to "Moderated Session")
* [speaker instructions](https://support.hopin.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056078432-Speaker-Instructions)

Log in to the session you're moderating at least 15 minutes before it starts, so that you can help the speaker troubleshoot any AV and connection issues, if necessary.   Each speaker has been set up as a "moderator" for their session as well, which means they shouldn't need you to turn on their AV.  However, issues happen, and they might need you to anyway.

During discussion sessions, you may want to enable AV for the attendees if they want to make a comment/ask a question out loud.  Attendees need to "Request to Share Audio and Video", which should then pop up on your screen.  As such, when the discussion session starts, you want to post in chat:

> If you wish to participate in the discussion, please Request To Enable Audio And Video in your HopIn window.  The moderator will enable your mic when it is time for you to speak.

However, note that we cannot have more than 9 people with mic enabled at the same time or auto-recording gets turned off.  As such, you'll want to keep careful control over how many people have live audio/video at once.  So try to disable them when they are done talking.  Encourage them to disable themselves by messaging:

> Thank you for contributing.  Please disable your AV now so that others can speak.

## Introducing speakers

Please briefly (15 seconds) introduce each speaker before they start, if it's at all reasonable to do so.  And then disable your audio/video so you don't show up on the screen or count towards the 9 maximum.

The 15 minutes before the talk are a good time to ask the speaker's name pronunciation, and their job title.

## CoC

Our code of conduct [is here](https://containerplumbing.org/conduct) and is the same as DevConf.   Any regular attendee who violates it can be booted; in borderline cases, ask folks on our private moderator chat.

## General Conference Information

Most of this is on the [schedule page](https://containerplumbing.org/schedule):

* All talks are being recorded.  Recordings will go up on the Red Hat Community youtube, and possibly elsewhere as well.
* There is no central place for slides, that's up to each speaker.
* If folks want a t-shirt, take the survey (see below)
* If people get "video streaming error", the best fix is to switch browsers.  Chrome/Chromium seems to work better for most people.

## Conference Survey

We are asking attendees to [fill out a survey](https://forms.gle/gamtSHwjXWD2VNxp9) on the conference.  At least 25 of the people who do will get a Container Plumbing Days t-shirt.  Please share the link to this survey at least once during your session(s).
