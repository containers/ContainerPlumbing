# Speaker Guide 

# In preparation for the conference
To have the best possible experience at Container Plumbing Days 2023 we have prepared the following checklist for you to prepare beforehand. Take a look at the following technical requirements and things you can do to prepare before the conference so you don't need to do them during the conference.

## Register to Hopin as a speaker
Be sure that you're registered for Container Plumbing Days 2023 at Hopin as a speaker (You can find the link for speaker registration in the email). If there is a message with "You're in!" at the beginning of the subject that means you are. Take the opportunity to add the conference duration to your calendar by clicking on "Add to calendar".

## Internet speed
Try to connect with a minimum of 5Mbit/s download and 2Mbit/s upload speed. The higher upload and download speeds will offer a better experience, ideally 30Mbit/s download and 10Mbit/s upload speed. Try limiting other consumers of your Internet capacity, e.g. try running software updates a day before to prevent them from running during the conference, pause or stop any large downloads, if need be disconnect other devices from your network. Using a physical cable connection is recommended. You can check your Internet speed by using an online network speed test website, search for Internet speed test in the web search engine of your choice.

## Web browser
Hopin supports Google Chrome (preferred) and Mozilla Firefox (backup) other browsers are not supported ([More info](https://support.hopin.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056078872-Browser-Compatibility-for-online-events-on-Hopin)). Please make sure that your browser version is up to date.

Note that Safari uses the same engine as Chrome, but anecdotal reports are that Safari causes problems, so please use Chrome instead.

Reduce the number of open tabs and disable unnecessary browser extensions. Try not to open several browser tabs with Hopin, or if you need to mute all but one of the tabs.

## Device
Do try using a desktop or laptop computer, if you're using a tablet or a mobile device make sure that you're using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

## Hopin Documentation
Browse [the documentation on Hopin](https://support.hopin.com/hc/en-us) tailored for attendees and speakers.

# During the conference
During the conference you might run into some issues, we have compiled a list of most common ones, and general recommendations to avoid them.

## Audio and Video
Here is a list of recommendations for the best experience with audio and video during the conference:

* You are not able to share audio/video by default. All speakers and attendees can request to share their audio and video. The session chair will then grant you access.
* To maximize speaker video or presentation video double click on that video stream, this will enlarge that portion of the video stream.
* Play audio using headphones, this will help in understanding the speaker, and prevent any audio feedback.
* If you have multiple input video/audio sources, be sure you set proper one.

## Conference support and where to test your A/V setup
Once in the hopin platform, as a speaker, you can access the Green Room and test your audio/video setup and slide sharing before your session starts. If you experience any issues, we will be providing support in the same room.

## For your session
Please join the session 10 minutes before the scheduled time to connect with the session chair and prepare your slides, audio, and video setup. The same applies to pre-recorded sessions, we ask you to be present during the stream and interact with the audience. Note that all live sessions are recorded, and will be shared on YouTube afterwards.

## Sharing screen
When you enter the session ask for permission to share your audio/video during the break. Once you are granted access, you can control screen sharing using the monitor icon in the row with four buttons along the bottom. If the icon is crossed with a red line that means you're not sharing your screen, click on the icon to start sharing.

On Linux desktops using Wayland sharing the screen in Firefox is somewhat involved. You might need to confirm twice what part of the screen you want to share.

Similarly using Chrome (or Chromium) on Linux desktop using Wayland sharing the whole screen might end up exposing a completely black screen. In that case, make sure that you're sharing the window of a single application or single tab within Chrome.

On Mac, you may have to alter security preferences to allow screen sharing. If you are not able to share, look under SystemPreferences → Security & Privacy → Screen Recording. Click on Google Chrome to enable sharing application windows. Please note changing the settings will close Google Chrome and you will need to open the browser again and rejoin the Hopin session.

## Sharing video during your session
Apart from sharing your screen, you will also have the option to share YouTube videos in a Session. You can find the instructions on how to do it [the Hopin documentation](https://support.hopin.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056080452-How-to-use-YouTube-Sharing-in-Sessions).
