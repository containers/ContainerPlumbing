## Session Details:

Podman is known for its tight and seamless integration into Linux systems. Staying true to the "containers are Linux" philosophy, we make containerization as easy as possible. A core component of modern Linux systems is systemd, which is the de-facto standard for managing services and their dependencies. Early on, we realized that a seamless integration of Podman and systemd is important to our users.

In this presentation, I will talk about and demo best practices how run systemd in Podman and the vice versa. I will show we can easily generate custom systemd unit files and explain how we can use systemd and Podman to automatically update containers.
