## Session Details:

In this session I want to give an overview about the state of container checkpoint and restore in crun, runc, Podman and CRI-O:

 * What is the technical background to checkpoint and restore a container

 * What new features were added concerning container migration in Podman recently

 * What is the difference in checkpoint and restore support in crun and runc

 * What is happening in CRI-O concerning pod and container migration (This part is already very close to the orchestration layer)
