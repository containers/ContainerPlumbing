## Session Details:

Fedora CoreOS and Fedora IoT share a lot of technologies: Fedora RPMs, rpm-ostree, podman, etc. So which one should you use for your project and which use cases are more suited one or the other?

In this talk we will walk through the common points between the two projects and the differences that make each of those project a good base for your next Edge or IoT project where running a full Kubernetes cluster might not be a good answer.
