## Session Details:

OCI Artifacts supports stand-alone artifacts, including Helm, Singularity, WASM and many others. However, most artifacts have references to other artifact types. Notary v2 signatures and SBoMs can reference any OCI Artifact. Helm Charts should be able to reference their images. A new OCI Artifact Manifest is evolving, enabling users to store all their content types, with their references in their production secured, highly reliable, OCI Artifact conformant registry.
