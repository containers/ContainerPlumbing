## Session Details:

In this session I'll present libkrun, a dynamic library that provides Virtualization-based process isolation capabilities.  Iâ€™ll show how it can be integrated with container tools to both strengthen the security boundaries of a workload, and enable those tools to support non-Linux operating systems.
