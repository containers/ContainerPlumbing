Finch is an open-source client that simplifies container development by providing a minimal native client and an opinionated distribution of other open-source components. In this session, we will introduce and demonstrate the features of Finch, including its simple installer, native client, and integration with nerdctl, containerd, and BuildKit. Attendees will learn about the benefits of Finch's approach to container development and how it streamlines the process for users. They will also learn about the integration of Finch with other open-source components and how it works within a virtual machine managed by Lima.
