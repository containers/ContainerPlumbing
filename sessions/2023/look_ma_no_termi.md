## Session Details:

A common challenge new users face when adopting containers is the lack of a tangible ui – having to learn all these new concepts _and_ use a terminal can be quite overwhelming! Well, this is no longer the case. Podman Desktop makes it easy for anyone to manage their containers, create images, and even deploy to Kubernetes, on any operating system! We’ll be demonstrating how Podman Desktop gives you a simple interface to manage your containers and images. We’ll also take a look underneath the hood at the technology that enables Podman Desktop - changes in Podman Machine that improve your experience running linux containers in non-linux environments. We will further discuss updates to the kube generate and play commands that developers easily transition their applications from a single node environment to a kubernetes cluster, as well as demonstrate Podman Desktop’s ability to deploy to kubernetes.
