# bootc - A new project for bootable containers 

**Presenters**: Colin Walters (Red Hat, Inc.)

**Session Type:** Presentation (25min)

**Topics**: Container OSes, bootc

## Session Details:

This presentation will take a look at the new github.com/containers/bootc project - what does it mean to install and *boot* a host system via a container image?  We'll see how this enables powerful customization and control, while allowing Linux administrators to build on every tool and technique they already know from creating application container images.
