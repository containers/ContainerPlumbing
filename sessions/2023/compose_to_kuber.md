# Compose to Kubernetes: Caveats, interoperability and transformations 

**Presenters**: Charlie Drage (Red Hat)

**Session Type:** Lightning Talk (5min)

**Topics**: Containers & Virtualization, Image formats & standards, Kompose, Docker Compose, Podman and Podman Desktop

## Session Details:

This presentation will cover the 1-1 translations from Docker Compose to Kubernetes as well as the difficulties and the caveats.

We will cover:
- The pitfalls going from Compose to Kubernetes / stuff that does not translate
- How we get around said pitfalls with labels / asking the user
- How projects such as Skaffold use Kompose
- How future projects such as Podman and Podman Desktop hope to achieve in converting from Compose to Kubernetes.
