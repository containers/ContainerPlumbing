## Session Details:

BuildKit is the next-gen container build framework replacing the old implementation of "docker build" command and the fastest way to build Dockerfiles. This talk gives an introduction to why BuildKit was created, the design decisions taken, and what sets it apart from other builders. You will learn how BuildKit can be used with different deployments and for developing new languages and tools for container building.
